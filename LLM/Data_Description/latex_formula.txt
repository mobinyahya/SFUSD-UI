Existing Variables:

 - $Z$: Set of zones.
 - $U$: Set of geographic units.
 - $N$: Total number of students.
 - $n_u$ number of students in unit $u$.
 - $q_u$ number of seats in unit $u$.
 - $f_u$: Sum of socio-economic score of students in unit $u$.
 - $R_u^k$: Number of students of race $k$ in unit $u$, $\forall u \in U, k \in K$, where $K := \left \{ \text{White, Asian, Latino} \right \}$
 - $x_{u,z}$: A binary decision variable indicating whether unit $u$ is part of zone $z$ or not.   $\forall u \in U, z \in Z$.
 - $N(u)$: Neighboring units to unit $u$â€™s.  $\forall u \in U$.
 - $\text{centroid}(z)$: A predefined centroid for zone $z$.
 - $Sch_u$: Number of schools in unit $u$,  $\forall u \in U$

 - Make sure any new variable that is defined, does not have "_" in the middle of the name. For example:
    - Unacceptable: math_quality_u
    - Acceptable: MathQuality_u
    - Unacceptable: high_frl_school_u
    - Acceptable: HighFrlSchool_u


 Constraints:

 - Contiguity:
    - Description: Make sure all zone are contiguous.
    - Formula:  $x_{u,z} \leq \sum_{v: v \in N(u), d_{v,z} \leq d_{u,\text{centroid}(z)}} x_{v,z}  \;\;\;\;\; \forall u \in U, z \in Z$

 - Shortage:
      Makes sure no zone has a shortage more than 15%, where shortage is
      percentage of students (GE students) in the zone, that don't get any seat (from GE capacities)
     $0.15 \cdot \sum_{u \in U} n_u x_{u,z}  \geq  |\sum_{u \in U} (n_u - q_u) x_{u,z}|   \;\;\;\;\;    \forall z \in Z$

- FRL Balance:
    - Description: Make sure students of low socioeconomic status groups are fairly distributed among zones.
     Our only metric to measure socioeconomic status, is FRL, which is the students eligibility for Free or Reduced Price Lunch.
     make sure the total FRL for students in each zone, is within an additive 15% of average FRL over zones.
    - Formula: $\sum_{u \in U} f_u x_{u,z}  \geq (\frac{\sum_{u \in U} f_u}{N} - 0.15) \cdot \sum_{u \in U} n_u x_{u,z}  \;\;\;\;\;   \forall z \in Z$

- Racial Balance:
    - Description: Make sure students of racial groups are fairly distributed among zones. For specific racial minority,
     make sure the percentage of students in each zone, is within an additive 15% of percentage of total students of that race.
    - Formula: $\sum_{u \in U} R_u^k x_{u,z}  \geq (\frac{R^k}{N} - 0.15) \cdot \sum_{u \in U} n_u x_{u,z}   \;\;\;\;\;   \forall z \in Z, k \in K$

- School Count Balance:
   - Description: makes sure all zones have almost similar number of schools. Compute the average number of schools per zone,
    by computing the total number of schools in the city and dividing it by the number of zones. Next, add a constraint
     to make sure the number of schools in each zone is within average number of schools per zone + or - 1.
   - Formula:  $1 \geq |\sum_{u \in U} \frac{Sch_u}{|Z|} - \sum_{u \in U} Sch_u x_{u,z}|  \;\;\;\;\;  \forall z \in Z$
